# EaglerRendered
Hello this is NoxShadow YT / HackerYijia / NotionJunar.
As many as you know, Replit has a data transfer limit of 10GiB a month, for large servers, this can be easy throtted.
And EaglerCraft is facing Mojiang's DMCA for porting the game files to javascript via TeaVMC Compiliatation, allowing players
, especially students, to play the game without owning a license. Especially when now Replit is transiting to paid-only: https://blog.replit.com/hosting-changes

This project meant to run EaglerCraft Bungeecord, on render.com, which offers a free subdomain nicer than projectname.username.repl.co.

# Deployment
